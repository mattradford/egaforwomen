<strong>Sold by UCH to Unison in 2005.</strong>

<p>The listed building is being restored by the builders <a href="http://www.bam.co.uk/">BAM</a>, led by Colin James.  The main build architects are <a href="http://www.squireandpartners.com/">Squire and Partners</a> and listed building architects are <a href="http://www.insall-architects.co.uk/">Donald Insall</a>.</p>

<p>Between November 2008 and February 2010, Jane Leighton - who started as curator and as Editorial Director - substantially developed the initial concept provided by EGA for Women.</p>
<p>EGAW are extremely grateful for her imaginative contribution to exhibition planning which created a sustainable structure for the gallery, and particularly for her ability to engage all participants fully in the project. John Cole of Unison is Project Director, and chairs the operational board, which oversees the project and includes Lynne Walker as a representative from EGAW. Emeline Winston is exhibition organizer.</p>

<strong>The current curatorial team are:</strong>

<p>Elizabeth Crawford (author of Enterprising Women: the Garretts and their Circle 2nd edition 2010).</p>

<p>Jennian Geddes (published widely on early women doctors e.g see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1712367/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1712367/</a>)</p>

<p>Lesley Hall (archivist at the Wellcome Library. Her interests include the history of gender and sexuality in the interwar years; see <a href="http://www.lesleyahall.net">www.lesleyahall.net</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/Narmadha">Narmaada Thiranagama</a>, Policy Officer (Women's Equality) at the <a href="http://www.tuc.org.uk/">TUC</a>.</p>

<p>Clare Bayley, Editorial Consultant 20th century.</p>

<p>Ivor Heal Design have been appointed as Exhibition Designers. New Angle will provide software and editorial content. Graham Wickham is the hardware specialist.</p>

<h3>Our Plans</h3>

<p>Since 2005 EGAW has been working with Unison to achieve a fitting memorial to Elizabeth Garrett Anderson in the original EGAH building. This has been formalized by a section 106 agreement between Unison and Camden Council for:</p>
<p><em>"...securing the creation and retention in perpetuity within the Community Space...[opening times]...of a publicly accessible museum/exhibition space focusing on the life and achievements of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and other women pioneers of the medical profession and the development of hospitals and medical facilities on the site of the Property and in London".</em>
</p>
<p><em>(The Community Space Plan, 2.18 (iv))</em></p>
<p>Elizabeth Garrett Anderson died in 1917. The exhibition will tell the story of her life's work and explore its impact on later struggles for equality including those undertaken by Unison.</p>
